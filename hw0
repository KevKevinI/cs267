## Bio
I am a first year PhD student in the Chemical Engineering Department working under Professor Martin Head-Gordon and shadow advised by Professor Ali Mesbah. In my undergraduate research, I mostly did experimental research in reactor design but I am currently interested in more computational projects for my PhD. I hope to gain a better grasp on computation and parallel computation. My proposed research project is utilizing electronic structure theory to describe supramolecular interactions relevant to self-assembly. Specifically, I hope to learn how to create software that utilizes parallelization for use in calculations for quantum chemistry and electronic structure. Although not necessarily directly related, one area that has been improved due to parallel computation is density functional theory (DFT).
  
## DC-DFT
DFT is a popular approach to solve quantum mechanical problems in studying matter(Capelle). Unfortunately, many approaches to DFT have a O(N3) complexity (Shimojo). This is an issue for larger simulations that involve thousands of atoms due to computation time and would not be feasible for most systems that large. There have been many different approaches to decrease the computation time for DFT calculations. One way that has been used to improve DFT is a divide and conquer approach (DC) utilizing massively parallel computers which allows for linear scaling algorithms (shimojo). DC-DFT involves using spatial decomposition by dividing the system into equal volume subsystems which are each able to be assigned to a processor on a parallel computer (shimojo). The basic approach is to calculate the electronic potentials using the electron density from the previous step. Next, the wavefunctions improved iteratively on all domains. The fermi energies are then determined. The new electron density is then calculated. These steps are repeated until the self-consistency between the electron density and wavefunctions are within tolerance. This program has been used and has been tested using many different platforms such as the BlueGene/L at LLNL and SGI Altix 3700 at the NASA Ames Research Center which were ranked on the top 500 list back in 2007.
